Thirsty crow

One hot summer day when there had been no rain for months and all the ponds and rivers had dried up. A thirsty crow was searching for water. At last, he spotted a pitcher of cool water in a garden and flew down to take a drink, but when he put his head into the neck of the picture, it was only half full, and the crow could not reach the water. 

The poor crow knew that if he did not get a drink, soon, he would die of thirst. He had to find some way of getting to the water in the picture as he looked around, wondering what to do. He saw some pebbles on the path and he had an idea, he picked up a pebble in his beak and dropped it into the pitcher. The water level rose a little. The bird got another pebble and dropped it in the water. A little more. The crow worked very hard, dropping more and more bubbles into the picture until the water was almost at the top, at last, the bird was able to reach the water, and he drank and drank until he could drink no more. His clever idea had saved his life.
